# In-Network Fusion for High Interference Signal Detection within CBRS Band
This codebase facilitates the fusion of multiple signal modalities, enabling enhanced detection and classification in environments with interference from various signal sources.
## Introduction
This repository provides a robust framework for signal detection in environments with multiple signal sources, such as radar pulses and 5G signals. The code leverages an in-network fusion approach to combine data from different modalities, improving detection performance even in high-interference scenarios. Designed to be adaptable, this framework supports various signal types and detection models, making it suitable for applications in shared spectrum environments. With the ability to handle complex interference, the code facilitates reliable signal detection, classification, and coexistence of different technologies. This code can be easily extended to work with different signal detection tasks and interference conditions.
